# E06a-Particles-and-Screen-Shake

In this Godot assignment, I created my own particles by using textures and particle materials. I changed many aspects of each asset to fit the purpose of the node. In this repository, you will find that I have created fire, smoke, and rain particles. You can also use the WASD controls to operate and move the camera provided. Thanks for viewing!
